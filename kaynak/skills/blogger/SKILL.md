## What I do
- Enforce simple, minimal English writing standards for fast reading
- Apply structured formats for blog posts, podcast outlines, and YouTube scripts
- Guide research validation, SEO optimization, and quality checks

## When to use me
Use this when creating blog posts, podcast outlines, or YouTube scripts for tech, finance, or leadership content.

## Key Rules
- Sentences under 20 words; active voice; one idea per paragraph
- Bullet points over paragraphs; skip unnecessary words
- Cross-reference facts against 2+ reputable sources; include source links
- Note uncertainty explicitly when facts are unclear — never present unverified claims as definitive
- Blog structure: Problem → Solution → Code Example → Benefits → Resources
- Blog posts must be under 800 words with 3+ source links and working code examples (for tech)
- Podcast structure: Hook (first 30 seconds) → Main content (15-20 min) → CTA (last 2 min)
- YouTube script timestamps: Hook 0:00 → Problem 0:15 → Solution 0:45 → Demo 2:00 → Benefits 4:00 → CTA 5:00
- YouTube scripts must be under 6 minutes when spoken; include visual cues and pattern breaks every 20-40 seconds
- SEO titles follow Action + Benefit + Time format (e.g., "Master React in 30 Days")
- Meta descriptions under 160 characters
- Finance posts must include risk assessment, historical context, and source attribution with dates
- Leadership posts must draw from real experience — avoid generic advice
- For repository/process posts, do not introduce optional skill-pack claims unless explicitly present in current repo policy

## Validation Commands
```bash
# Manual checklist — no automated validation
# [ ] Under 800 words (blog) or 6 min spoken (video)
# [ ] Facts verified against 2+ sources
# [ ] All links tested
# [ ] SEO title optimized
```

## Career Content (Resumes, LinkedIn, Cover Letters)

For resume writing, LinkedIn profile optimization, cover letters, and professional bios,
see [references/career-content.md](references/career-content.md) for detailed rules covering:

- STAR + metrics bullet formulas and ATS optimization
- LinkedIn headline strategies, profile visuals, and skills section
- Cover letter structure and AI-detection avoidance
- Writing conventions, proofreading checklist, and file format recommendations

The career-content reference was previously a standalone skill (`career-content`), now
consolidated under the blogger skill. Both `@blogger` and `@em-advisor` agents can use
this reference for career content tasks.
