# Legal Advisor Skill

## When to Activate

Activate this skill when:
- Answering legal questions tied to a specific country or jurisdiction
- Analyzing a case, situation, or scenario against applicable law
- Reviewing regulatory compliance (privacy, financial, employment, environmental, etc.)
- Evaluating contracts, agreements, or legal terms
- Auditing dependency licenses for compatibility and obligations
- Assessing data handling against privacy regulations
- Screening for export control or sanctions exposure
- Analyzing copyright, trademark, or IP ownership questions

## Research Methodology

### IRAC Framework

Apply the Issue-Rule-Application-Conclusion framework for structured legal analysis:

1. **Issue:** Frame the precise legal question. Avoid vague or compound questions.
2. **Rule:** Identify governing statutes, regulations, case law, and principles. Cite specific provisions with source references.
3. **Application:** Apply the rules to the specific facts. Address counterarguments and edge cases.
4. **Conclusion:** Provide a reasoned assessment. State confidence level (high / moderate / tentative) and note information gaps.

### Source Hierarchy

Evaluate sources by authority, in descending order:
- **Binding:** Constitution, statutes, regulations, supreme court decisions
- **Persuasive:** Lower court decisions, decisions from other jurisdictions, obiter dicta
- **Guidance:** Regulatory body publications, official interpretations, advisory opinions
- **Commentary:** Law review articles, treatises, practitioner guides

Always prefer official government sources over secondary summaries. Note when sources may be outdated, repealed, or overruled.

Reference: `references/research-methodology.md` for detailed source evaluation guidance.

## Jurisdiction Framework

Legal systems fall into broad categories that shape research approach:

- **Common Law:** Case law and judicial precedent are primary. Statutes interpreted by courts.
- **Civil Law:** Codified statutes are primary. Case law is persuasive but not binding.
- **Mixed/Hybrid:** Elements of both common and civil law traditions.
- **Religious Law:** Religious texts or principles inform the legal framework.
- **Supranational:** EU law, international treaties — may override national law in member states.

## License & Compliance Checks

### License Compatibility Audit
1. Identify all dependencies and their declared licenses
2. Cross-reference against the license compatibility matrix
3. Flag incompatible, unlicensed, or restricted dependencies
4. Document attribution and source-disclosure requirements
5. Recommend alternatives for problematic dependencies

### Data Privacy Assessment
1. Identify data types handled (PII, financial, health, etc.)
2. Map applicable regulations by jurisdiction
3. Review data flows: collection → storage → processing → sharing
4. Flag missing safeguards and consent mechanisms
5. Recommend privacy-by-design improvements

### Export Control Screening
1. Identify encryption-related code and ECCN classification
2. Check for dependencies with export restrictions
3. Flag geographic restrictions on distribution or use

## Common License Obligations
